### Programming Language Trend Analysis

Being a programmer in python I decided to do something different this time.
I wanted to do an exploratory data analysis on the __StackoverFlow Survey dataset 
using the python data science and machine learning methods__ .

##### This data has about 129 columns and  more than 95,000 Rows!

we will use around five thousand samples for our processing
